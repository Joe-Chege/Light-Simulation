# LED Traffic Light Simulation

This project simulates a traffic light system with a pedestrian crossing button using an ESP32. 

## Components Required
- ESP32 Development Board
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 1 Push Button
- Resistors (appropriate values for LEDs and button)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Complete the code in `TrafficLightSimulation.ino` based on the following tasks:
   - Implement the traffic light timing (Red: 5 seconds, Yellow: 2 seconds, Green: 3 seconds).
   - Add functionality to allow pedestrians to cross when the button is pressed.
   - Ensure the system returns to normal traffic light behavior after the crossing period.
   - Add comments explaining your logic and code structure.
3. Commit your changes to a new branch named after you.
4. Push the changes and create a pull request with a clear description of what you modified.
